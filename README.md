# khan-academy

These are all of the projects I made during the Khan Academy JavaScript programming course. They're here in case Khan Academy dies one day and I lose all of them. None of them work by the way, but I think if you config something with canvas or something it should work. You can see them all [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_1127564262807385677865642/projects).

There are some pretty interesting archived projects here. My favourites are `eyes-brown-bear`, `panda-eating-bamboo` and `animal-attack`. You can, uh, imagine that they look really cool, or something.
