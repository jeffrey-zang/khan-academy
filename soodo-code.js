// How do we get our ideas into code?

// Draw the face, an oval in the center
ellipse(width/2, height/2, 200, 300);

// Draw the two eyes, two ovals, about 2/3 up the face, and 1/5 the size of the face
ellipse(width/2 - 40, height/2 - 50, 40, 40);
ellipse(width/2 + 40, height/2 - 50, 40, 40);

// Draw the mouth, a line going halfway across the face, 1/3 the way up
